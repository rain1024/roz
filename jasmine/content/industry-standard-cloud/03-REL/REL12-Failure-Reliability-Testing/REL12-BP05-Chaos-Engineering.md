# REL12-BP05: Test resiliency using chaos engineering

## Description

Conduct chaos experiments để validate resilience.

## Implementation Guidance

- Define steady state hypothesis
- Introduce controlled failures
- Run experiments in production
- Validate recovery mechanisms
- Document and share findings

## Risk Level

Medium - Untested resilience assumptions fail.
