# SUS03-BP01: Optimize for asynchronous patterns

## Description

Use async processing để improve efficiency.

## Implementation Guidance

- Decouple processing from requests
- Use message queues
- Process during low-carbon periods
- Reduce real-time requirements
- Batch similar operations

## Risk Level

Low - Async patterns reduce peak resource usage.
