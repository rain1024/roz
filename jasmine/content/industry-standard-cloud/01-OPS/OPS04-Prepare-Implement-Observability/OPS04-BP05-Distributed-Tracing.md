# OPS04-BP05: Implement distributed tracing

## Description

Enable tracing across microservices.

## Implementation Guidance

- W3C Trace Context propagation
- Jaeger or X-Ray for trace collection
- Sampling strategies for high-volume services
- Trace-based debugging workflows
- Service dependency visualization

## Risk Level

Medium - Distributed systems without tracing are hard to debug.
