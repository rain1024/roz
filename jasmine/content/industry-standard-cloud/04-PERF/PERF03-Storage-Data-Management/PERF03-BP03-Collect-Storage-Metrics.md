# PERF03-BP03: Collect storage-related metrics

## Description

Monitor storage performance metrics.

## Implementation Guidance

- Track IOPS utilization
- Monitor throughput
- Measure latency p50, p95, p99
- Alert on performance degradation
- Review trends regularly

## Risk Level

Medium - Unmonitored storage degrades silently.
